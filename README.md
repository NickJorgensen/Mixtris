Mixtris
=======

Mixtris is simple desktop application that lets you rediscover your favorite music by systematically walking you through your entire music collection.  As you progress from one song to the next, a simple up or down rating system lets you further refine your collection into separate mixes.  Easily control which mixes you want to hear more of, i.e. only play songs you think are amazing, or just find and play songs that you havenâ€™t heard in a while.  

Mixtris can be installed on Windows or OSX operating system.  Mixtris does not delete, copy, upload, or import any music files.  Just select any existing music folders and Mixtris will unobtrusively work with what you got.  The music player/mixer can be run on any html5 enabled browser that is connected to the same local area network your Mixtris host computer runs on.
