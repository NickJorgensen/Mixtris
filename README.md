=======

Mixtris is a music player that lets users intelligently shuffle through their music collection and mark songs they think are worth hearing while excluding songs they donâ€™t want to hear again.  Users control which mixes they want to hear more of, only play songs they think are amazing, or just find and play songs that they have not heard in a while.
